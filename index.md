## GM @ NeurIPS

The Graph Mining team at Google is excited to be presenting at the 2020 NeurIPS Conference. Please join us on Sunday, December 6th, at 1PM EST. The Expo information page can be found [here](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020/Schedule?showEvent=20237). This page will be updated with video links after the workshop.

## Introduction
_Vahab Mirrokni_

In this talk, Vahab Mirrokni, the founder of the Graph Mining team, introduces Graph Mining at a high level. This talk touches on what graphs are, why they are important, and where they appear in the world of big data. The talk then dives into the core tools that make up the Graph Mining toolbox, and lays out several canonical use cases. This talk sets up the rest of the Expo by introducing common terms and themes that will appear in the following talks.

## Application Stories

#### Modeling COVID with Graph Neural Networks
_Amol Kapoor_

In this talk, Amol Kapoor talks about how we used GNNs to predict the change in COVID caseloads in US counties. This presentation is based on the recent paper, Examining COVID-19 Forecasting using Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03113)). 

#### Using Graph Mining for Privacy 
_Alessandro Epasto_

#### Causal Inference
_Jean Pouget-Abadie_

## Graph Mining At Scale

#### Grale: Learning Graphs
_Jonathan Halcrow_

In this talk, Jonathan Halcrow discusses the Grale graph building framework, a highly scalable tool for generating learned similarity graphs from arbitrary data. This talk is based on the recent paper, Grale: Designing Networks for Graph Learning ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12002?)). 

#### Similarity Ranking
_Alessandro Epasto_

#### Clustering at Scale
_Vahab Mirrokni_

#### Community Detection
_Jakub Kuba Łącki_

#### Label Propagation
_Allan Heydon_

## Graph Neural Networks

#### GNNs and Graph Embeddings
_Bryan Perozzi_

#### PPRGo: GNNs at Scale
_Amol Kapoor_

In this talk, Amol Kapoor talks about some of the challenges with running GNNs at scale, and presents a solution called PPRGo. This presentation is based on the recent paper, Scaling Graph Neural Networks with Approximate PageRank ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01570)). 

#### Debiasing GNNs
_John Palowitch_

#### Learning Multiple Embeddings
_Alessandro Epasto_

## Algorithms, Systems, and Scalability

#### Graph Tensor
_Martin Blais_

In this talk, Martin Blais discusses the infrastructure required to train graph learning models at Google scale.

#### Distributed Graph Algorithms
_Jakub Kuba Łącki_

#### Multi-core Parallel Graph Clustering
_Jakub Kuba Łącki_
